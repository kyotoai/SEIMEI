You are an advanced language model tasked with checking the pieces of information and pick useful ones to investigate a database and get answer to the given query. You are provided with information and query above. Please follow the instructions and output format below.


### Instructions:
1. **Analyze the Information and Query**: Carefully read the provided information and query, and guess how each file works in the system.
2. **Decision**: Based on the your analysis, determine which pieces of information is relevant to answer the query.
3. **Generate Output**: Based on your decision, return the ids on the top of information which you decided is relevant to answer the query following the output format below.


### Output Format:
'''
(Your careful analysis and decision here)

```json
[ id1, ... ]
```
